[offset:0]
[00:12.00]Nibblin' on sponge cake
[00:13.00]
[00:14.00]Watching the sun bake
[00:18.00]All of those tourists covered in oil
[00:26.00]Strumming my six-string
[00:29.00]On my front porch swing
[00:33.00]Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginning to boil
[00:40.00]Wasted away again in Margaritaville
[00:48.00]Searching for my lost shaker of salt
[00:56.00]Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
[01:03.00]But I know
[01:05.00]It's nobody's fault
[01:11.00]I don't know the reason
[01:15.00]I stayed here all season
[01:19.00]Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
[01:27.00]But it's a real beauty
[01:30.00]A Mexican cutie
[01:34.00]How it got here I haven't a clue
[01:42.00]Wasted away again in Margaritaville
[01:50.00]Searching for my lost shaker of salt
[01:57.00]Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
[02:04.00]Now I think
[02:07.00]Must be Buffet's fault
[02:44.00]I blew out my flip-flop
[02:48.00]Stepped on a pop-top
[02:51.00]Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
[02:59.00]But there's booze in the blender
[03:02.00]And soon it will render
[03:06.00]That frozen concoction that helps me hang on, hang on
[03:14.00]Wasted away again in Margaritaville
[03:22.00]Searching for my lost shaker of salt
[03:30.00]Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
[03:36.00]But I know
[03:39.00]It's my own damn fault
[03:44.00]Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
[03:51.00]And I know
[03:55.00]It's our owned damned fault
